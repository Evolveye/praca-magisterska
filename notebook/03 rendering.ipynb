    "2. **Staging buffer** -- Mapping from host to staging buffer, then copying staging into target buffer. Faster for reading from by GPU\n",
    "3. **Ring Buffer** -- Big buffer with data for several frames. It reduces the need for buffers updating\n",
    "4. **Double/Tripple/N Buffering** -- storing several buffers and commiting it to GPU one by one. When first is rendering, second may be generated by CPU"
